Use Case 6: AI-Driven Resource Allocation and Optimization
- Dataset Link 1: While I was unable to find specific datasets directly related to resource allocation and optimization, datasets related to cloud usage and performance metrics could be adapted. Examples include AWS CloudWatch metrics, Azure Monitor data, or Google Cloud Monitoring data. These datasets are often specific to the cloud provider and require access to a cloud environment.
- Resource Link 1: Cloud provider documentation on resource optimization and cost management. For example, AWS Cost Explorer documentation, Azure Cost Management + Billing documentation, or Google Cloud Cost Management documentation.
