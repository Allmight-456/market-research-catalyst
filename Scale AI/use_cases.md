*   **How GenAI/ML can be applied:**
    *   **ML Models for Active Learning:** Implement active learning techniques using ML models to identify data samples that the model is most uncertain about. These samples are then prioritized for labeling, as they are likely to provide the most significant improvement in model performance.
    *   **LLMs for Data Understanding and Feature Extraction:** Use LLMs to analyze the content of data samples (e.g., text, images) and extract relevant features that can be used to predict the value of labeling that sample.  For example, an LLM could identify images with complex scenes or ambiguous objects as high-priority candidates for labeling.
    *   **GenAI for Data Augmentation:** Use GenAI to augment existing datasets with variations of existing samples, focusing on areas where the model is known to struggle. This can improve model robustness and generalization.

*   **Potential Benefits:**
    *   **Reduced Labeling Costs:**  Focus labeling efforts on the most valuable data samples, reducing the overall amount of data that needs to be labeled.
    *   **Faster Model Training:**  Achieve desired model performance with less data, leading to faster training times.
    *   **Improved Model Accuracy:**  Train models on a more diverse and representative dataset, leading to improved accuracy and generalization.
    *   **Optimized Resource Allocation:**  Allocate labeling resources more efficiently by focusing on the areas where they will have the greatest impact.
